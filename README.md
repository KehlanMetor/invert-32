# invert-32
Invert 32 is an encoding algorithm that makes your text safe for transmissions

## ðŸ’½ How it works
Really simple, it just inverts the letter depending on its position in the alphabet (excluding special characters)

## ðŸ’» Converting index

### To complete the table where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to its corresponding letter at the opposite end of the alphabet, you can follow this pattern:

The alphabet has 26 letters, so you pair the first letter with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.

Here is the complete table:
